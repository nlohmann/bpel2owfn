@node Overview
@chapter Overview

@section Introduction

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} is a compiler translating a business processes expressed in
@acronym{BPEL, Business Process Execution Language for Web Services}
[ACD@math{^+}03] to an @acronym{oWFN, open Workflow Net} [MRS05].
This @acronym{oWFN} can be used to:

@itemize
@item check controllability [Mar03, Wei04],
@item generate the operating guidelines [MRS05],
@item check for deadlocks, or
@item check any temporal logic formula with the model checking tools.
@end itemize

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} uses static analysis to make the generated @acronym{oWFN}
as compact as possible to analyze a chosen property. This is called
@i{flexible model generation} (see @ref{Future Work}).

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} is the successor from @acronym{BPEL2PN} [SHS05], a
Java-based compiler generating low-level Petri nets. @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} can be
understood as a re-implementation for extensibility and performance issues. Its
functionality is a superset of the functionality of @acronym{BPEL2PN}.
@footnote{In fact, @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} can simulate the behavior of
@acronym{BPEL2PN} with a command-line parameter (see @ref{Invoking BPEL2oWFN}).}

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} was written by Niels Lohmann, Christian Gierds
and Dennis Reinert. It is part of the Tools4@acronym{BPEL} project
funded by the German Bundesministerium f@"ur Bildung und Forschung. See
@url{http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/tools4bpel} for details.



@section Translation Process

The translation process of the @acronym{BPEL} business process is performed in
six steps which we describe briefly in this section:

@enumerate
@item @b{Lexical and syntactical analysis}. @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} parses the
input process according to the specification of @acronym{BPEL4WS} version 1.1
[ACD@math{^+}03]. All information about the process is collected in a symbol
table for further use.

@item @b{Semantic analysis}. The input file is checked against the constraints
of the specification, e.g.@: that each defined link has to be used as source and
target exactly once. @acronym{BPEL} processes violating these constraints are
rejected.

@item @b{@acronym{AST} generation}. For further analysis steps the exact syntax
(indentation etc.) is not used any more. The input process is represented as
an @acronym{AST, abstract syntax tree}. While generating the @acronym{AST}, the
implicit transformation rules of @acronym{BPEL} (e.g.@: the presence of an
@samp{otherwise}-branch with an empty activity) are applied.

@item @b{Net generation}. The nodes of the @acronym{AST} are used to create
the Petri net using the pattern database by applying `unparse'-rules (rules
associating each node with a pattern).

@item @b{Net optimization} (optional). To reduce the generated net several
structural reduction rules can be applied, e.g.@: to merge sequences.

@item @b{Net output}. The generated Petri net can be exported in several file
formats.
@end enumerate



@section Concepts of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}

In this section we describe the main concepts of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} used to
realize the translation. Reading this section is not necessary for using
@acronym{BPEL2oWFN}, yet knowing the underlying algorithms and data structures
not only helps to locate bugs, but also helps you to customize
@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} or request a feature.

@anchor{Abstract Syntax Tree}
@subsection Abstract Syntax Tree

The @acronym{AST, abstract syntax tree} is an abstraction of the
syntax tree generated while parsing the @acronym{BPEL} process: any
unnecessary information (e.g.@: indention, brackets or other
``syntax-supporting'' elements) is omitted. It is the central data
structure of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}. The nodes of the @acronym{AST} are
annotated during the analysis steps. These annotations are used to
select the most compact Petri net pattern from the pattern database
to check a given property.


@anchor{Pattern Database}
@subsection Pattern Database

The idea of flexible model generation is to find the most compact
model to check a given property. The patterns of the Petri net
semantics of [Sta05] are designed to fit in any given context.
However when the context is known some behavior modeled in the
patterns (i.e.@: some of the nodes) can be safely removed without
changing its semantics. @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} is designed to hold
several sets of Petri net patterns each suitable in certain
contexts. These patterns are collected in a pattern database.


@anchor{Petri Net Class}
@subsection Petri Net Class

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} provides many algorithms and data structures to
build, represent, modify and simplify Petri nets and open workflow
nets, resp.@: They are the interface between the pattern database and
the file output for the model checking tool. The functions are
collected in an extensible class allowing to add more output file
formats, structural simplification rules (optimized to preserve certain
properties such as deadlock freedom or liveness) or abstractions
(e.g.@: abstraction from variables, abstraction from external behavior).





@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Invoking BPEL2oWFN
@chapter Invoking @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}

The standard invocation of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} is:

@example
bpel2owfn -i inputfile.bpel -f owfn -o
@end example

where @file{inputfile.bpel} is a @acronym{BPEL} process. The option
@samp{-f owfn} cause @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} to generate an open workflow net. This
net is written to a file named @file{inputfile.owfn}, because of the option
@samp{-o}. For more examples, see @ref{Examples}.

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} can be called without any parameter. In this case, it acts
as a parser for @acronym{BPEL}, that reads its input from the standard input
(@code{stdin}).





@section Options

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} supports the following command-line options:

@table @samp
@item --help
@itemx -h
Print an overview of the command-line options and exit.

@item --version
@itemx -v
Print version information and exit.

@item --input=@var{filename}.bpel
@itemx -i @var{filename}.bpel
Read @acronym{BPEL} input from file @file{@var{filename}.bpel}.
If this parameter is omitted, input is read from standard input (@code{stdin}).

@item --output[=@var{filename}]
@itemx -o
The generated files are written to a file called @var{filename}. If the short
form is used or the @var{filename} is omitted, the input file name is taken and 
extended by the suffix of the chosen file format(s). If this parameter is
omitted, the output is passed to the standard output (@code{stdout}).

@item --log[=@var{filename}]
@itemx -l 
All additional information like warnings and processing information
are written to a file called @var{filename}. If the short form is used
or the @var{filename} is omitted, the output file name is taken and 
extended by the suffix @samp{.log}. If this parameter is omitted, the
information is passed to the standard error output (@code{stderr}).

@item --debug=1-4 | flex | bison
@itemx -d 1-4 | flex | bison
This option triggers different debug levels, and can enable additional
information from Flex and Bison about how the input is lexed and parsed.

@item --bpel2pn
This option makes @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} behave like its predecessor,
@acronym{BPEL2PN}: it generates a Petri net @acronym{LoLA} format and an
information file. The option @samp{--bpel2pn} is a shortcut for
@samp{--mode=petrinet --format=lola --format=info --output}.
@end table





@subsection Modes

When invoking @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} several modes are possible.

@table @samp
@item --mode=@var{modus}
@itemx -m @var{modus}

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} supports four different modes for handling 
@acronym{BPEL}, so @samp{@var{modus}} can be one of the following options:

@table @samp
@item ast
Outputs the @acronym{AST, abstract syntax tree} generated while
parsing the input file to standard output. This option is mostly
used for debugging reasons since it shows the implicit transformations
and the phylum names used when generating the Petri net.

@c @item cfg
@c For control flow analysis (a form of static analysis) a @acronym{CFG, Control
@c Flow Graph} is generated. It might be printed in graphical (Dot)
@c representation. This option is in an early alpha-stage and is not used for any
@c analysis steps yet. For more information, see @ref{Future Work}.

@item petrinet
Generates a Petri net representing the semantics of the given
process. Other options can be added to simplify or modify that generated Petri
net (see below).

@item pretty
Outputs the parsed @acronym{BPEL} file in @acronym{XML} representation. Any
unnecessary attributes are omitted. This option is mostly used for debugging
reasons as it shows the implicit transformations and the identifiers of the
@acronym{BPEL} constructs.
@end table
@end table
Please note that you can only use at most one mode.




@subsection Additional parameters

These options control some Petri net-related options. See @ref{Petri Net-related
Functions} for more details.

@table @samp
@item --parameter=@var{par}
@itemx -p @var{par}

@table @samp
@item simplify
Structurally simplify the generated Petri net.

@item finishloop
Add an extra loop transition to the final place of the generated Petri net to
live-lock the system in order to find deadlocks.

@item nostandardfaults
When the parameter is set, only used-defined faults using the @code{<throw>}
activity can occur.

@item cyclicwhile
When the parameter is set, the pattern for the @code{<while>} activity is
cyclic as depicted in Fig. 18 of [Sta05]. If the parameter is not set
(standard case), the pattern is acyclic: the activity embedded in the
@code{<while>} activity is at most executed once, chosen non-deterministically.
@end table
@end table

If you want to enable more than one parameter you have to add @samp{-p}/
@samp{--parameter} to each parameter.





@subsection Output formats

Especially for the Petri net mode, a variaty of output formats are supported,
see @ref{File Formats} for more information. There are invoked by the
following option:

@table @samp

@item --format=@var{fileformat}
@itemx -f @var{fileformat} 

@table @samp
@item apnn
Create a Petri net in @acronym{APNN, Abstract Petri Net Notation}. Implies the
mode @samp{petrinet}.

@item dot
Create a Dot representation of the structure generated in the current mode
which can be any kind of Petri net (mode @samp{petrinet}).@c  or the control flow
@c graph (mode @samp{cfg}).

@item info
Create an additional information file. Implies the mode @samp{petrinet}.

@item lola
Create a @acronym{LoLA} place/transition net. Implies the mode @code{petrinet}.

@item owfn
Create a low-level @acronym{oWFN} in @acronym{LoLA} file format. Implies the
mode @samp{petrinet}.

@item pep
Create a Petri net in low-level @acronym{PEP} notation. Implies the mode
@samp{petrinet}.

@item pnml
Create a @acronym{PNML} Petri net. Implies the mode @samp{petrinet}.

@item xml
Create an @acronym{XML, Extensible Markup Lanuage} file. Implies the mode
@code{pretty}.
@end table
@end table

If you want to use more than one output file format you have to add @samp{-f}/
@samp{--fileformat} to each file format. Please note that the underlying modes
of the given file formats are the same, i.e. you cannot create @acronym{XML} and
@acronym{LoLA} files together since @acronym{XML} uses the mode @samp{pretty}
whereas @acronym{LoLA} uses the mode @samp{petrinet}.





@anchor{Examples}
@section Examples
In this section we show some examples how @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} can be
invoked.

@table @samp
@item bpel2owfn -i sample.bpel -flola -finfo -o -p simplify

Reads the file @file{sample.bpel}, generates a structural simplified
low-level Petri net and saves it in a @acronym{LoLA} file
@file{sample.lola}. For further information a file
@file{sample.info} is generated.

@item bpel2owfn -i sample.bpel -fowfn -d3 -o

Reads the file @file{sample.bpel}, generates a low-level open
workflow net and saves it in an @acronym{oWFN} file
@file{sample.owfn}. For further information a file
@file{sample.info} is generated. During the conversion several debug
messages are printed to standard output.

@item @var{prog} | bpel2owfn -fdot -m petrinet | dot -Tpng -osample.png

Runs the program @var{prog} and reads its output as @acronym{BPEL}
process, generates a Petri net and outputs its Dot representation.
This stream is read by Dot which layouts the Petri net and creates an output
@acronym{PNG, Portable Network Graphic} file @file{sample.png}.

@item bpel2owfn -i sample.bpel -m ast

Reads the file @file{sample.bpel} and prints the abstract syntax tree
(@acronym{AST}) to standard output.
@end table





@section Exit Values

When @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} is invoked and run without any error, the
exit value is 0.

@table @asis
@item 0
@b{No error.} The input file could be correctly opened, parsed and
the output file(s) could be generated without any error.


@item 1
@b{Lexical or syntax error.} This error occurs while lexing or
parsing the input file. It is thrown by the lexer or the parser,
resp.@: Usually the `source' of the error (i.e.@: the filename and line
number) is indicated together with the unexpected (last read) and
expected token.

An example:
@cartouche
@smallexample
Error while parsing

syntax error, unexpected X_SLASH, expecting X_OPEN
Error in `example.bpel' in line 12:
  token/text last read was `/'
@end smallexample

Please note that the indicated position (i.e.@: the line number) may
be fuzzy --- it should be understood as a hint to the erroneous
line.

@item 2
@b{`File not found' exception.} The given input file was not found
resp.@: could not be opened.

An example:
@cartouche
@smallexample
An error has occurred while parsing "example.bpel"!

@b{`Dynamic cast error' exception.} While building an internal scope
tree an unexpected error has occurred.


@item 40
@b{Node not found.}


@item 41
@b{`Node already defined' exception.} While generating the Petri net
a node was found having a history entry covered by another node
before.

An example:
@cartouche
@smallexample
An error has occurred while parsing "example.bpel"!

Exception #41 occurred!

   Place with role `1.internal.final' already defined.
@end smallexample
@end cartouche


@item 42
@b{`Merging error' exception.} While generating the Petri net an
error occurred while merging two nodes. It happens either when one
of the nodes was not found or one of the nodes is a guarded
transition---the merging of guarded transitions is not yet
supported.


@item 43
@b{`Arc error' exception.} While generating the Petri net an error
occurred while adding an arc to the net. It happens either on type
errors --- i.e.@: an arc between two transitions (or two places, resp.)
should be drawn --- or when the source or target node of an arc was
not found.
@end table

Please report the occurrence of any exception with numbers 30--50
since it indicates a bug in @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} we would like to fix
immediately (see @ref{Reporting Bugs}).





@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node File Formats
@chapter File Formats

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} can generate several file formats:

@section Petri Net File Formats
These file formats output the generated Petri net model to various Petri net
file formats to support as much model checking and analysis tools as possible.
The nodes of the Petri net are named using the internal (numeric) names
generated by @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}. For more information on the node naming
conventions of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}, see @ref{Naming Conventions}.

In all file formats, the inital place of the process, the process clock and all
variable places are initially marked.

@table @b


@item @acronym{LoLA} place/transition net

A (low-level) place/transition net as described in [LoLA].
The first entry of the history of each node is added as a comment.


@item @acronym{oWFN} in @acronym{LoLA} format

An open workflow net is a Petri net with an @i{interface}, i.e.@: two sets of
places: @i{input places} and @i{output places}. Additionally an open workflow
net has a set of final markings. To represent @acronym{oWFN}s
the @acronym{LoLA} format was extended to implement this categorization.


@item Abstract Petri Net Notation (@acronym{APNN})

A (low-level) place/transition net in Abstract Petri Net Notation as described
in [BKK95]. An @samp{@var{arcname}} value is just added to meet the
syntactic requirements and is just an enumeration of the arcs (@samp{a1},
@samp{a2}, @dots{}).


@item Low-level @acronym{PEP} Notation

A (low-level) place/transition net in low-level @acronym{PEP, Programming
Environment based on Petri Nets} notation as described in [PEP].

@end table




@section Info-files

The Info-files are generated when any command-line option is used which imply
Petri net-generation. When reading from a file @file{process.bpel} a file
@file{process.info} is generated. This file sums up all places and transitions
together with their internal (numeric) name and their complete history:

@cartouche
@smallexample
PLACES:
ID  TYPE        ROLES
@var{a list of places}

TRANSITIONS:
ID      ROLES
@var{a list of transitions}
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

These files are generated to document the connection between the generated
output file and the chosen Petri net patterns. In future distributions of
@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} the Info-files will be used to annotate witness and
counter-example paths, resp.@: and to ``re-translate'' Petri net properties
(e.g.@: a dead transition) to the input @acronym{BPEL} process.



@anchor{Naming Conventions}
@subsection Naming Conventions

@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} generates the output Petri net by creating and
merging parameterized patterns of the Petri net semantics defined in
[Sta05]. Due to merging and simplifying the Petri net nodes
``belong'' to more than one pattern. For example, in a sequence the
initial place of the sequence and the initial place of its first
activity are merged so that the final Petri net contains one place
with two @i{roles}.

The roles of each place are collected during the Petri net
generation. They form the @i{history} of the node. It is used to
locate errors of the modeled business process: If, for example,
@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} generates a Petri net of a business process and
the model checker @acronym{LoLA} finds a dead transition, its
history helps to find which @acronym{BPEL} constructs are affected
and in this case will never be executed.

The roles are named using the following conventions:

@itemize
@item Each @acronym{BPEL} activity has been assigned an identifier during the
syntactic analysis of the input process. Each node added to the Petri net
from the Petri net pattern of that activity begins with that identifier.

For example, @acronym{BPEL}'s activity process has the identifier @samp{1},
so that all nodes of the process pattern begin with @samp{1.}. To find out the
identifiers of a given process use the @samp{--xml} command-line option which
prints the id of each activity as an @acronym{XML} attribute.

@item In most cases each @acronym{BPEL} activity can be source or target of
links. The semantics defined in [Sta05] organizes this link concept by several
wrappers. For an activity with the identifier @var{id} the nodes of the wrapper
begin with @samp{@var{id}.} whereas the nodes of the actual activity begin
with @samp{@var{id}.internal.}.

@item The roles of nodes of the stop pattern of a process or scope with
identifier @samp{@var{id}} begin with @samp{@var{id}.internal.stop.}.

The same schema is used for fault handlers
(@samp{@var{id}.internal.faultHandler.}), compensation handlers
(@samp{@var{id}.internal.compensationHandler.}) and event handlers
(@samp{@var{id}.internal.eventHandler.}), resp.

@item Labels (e.g.@: @samp{initial}) in a figure of [Sta05] are appended to the
id string (e.g.@: @samp{@var{id}.internal.initial}). If both numeric (e.g.@:
@samp{p1}) and textual (e.g.@: @samp{initial}) labels are depicted in a figure,
the latter is used.

@item The labels of fault-throwing transitions also contain the last place of
the positive control flow: If, for example, a reply activity throws a fault,
the fault-throwing transition reads from the place labeled
@samp{@var{id}.internal.running} and is labeled
@samp{@var{id}.internal.throwFault.running}.

@item In parameterized patterns (e.g.@: an assign activity or all structured
activities) the labels of the figures of [Sta05] are trailed by an numeration
(e.g.@: @samp{@var{id}.internal.copy.@var{number}.running}).

@end itemize





@section Dot Graphics
To bugfix@footnote{The Petri nets usually have a large number of nodes so that
the graphical representation of a `real world' process would not be suitable to
process, read or understand. That is why the Dot output shall be seen as a
means to debug small patterns.} the implemented Petri net patterns
@acronym{BPEL2oWFN} implements a graph representation of the generate Petri
net.




@c ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Petri Net Patterns
@chapter Petri Net Patterns
In version @value{VERSION} of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} the following Petri net
patterns are implemented:



@section Petri net semantics from [Sta05]

The Petri net semantics for @acronym{BPEL4WS} from Christian Stahl
(Humboldt-Universit@"at zu Berlin) published in [Sta05].

@subsection Overview

Feature complete semantics covering both positive control flow with
event handling and negative control flow (fault and compensation
handling).

@anchor{Limitations of the semantics}
@subsection Limitations of the semantics
@itemize

@item Only one instance of a @acronym{BPEL} process can be
transformed into a Petri net.

@item The semantics abstracts from the connection of a
@acronym{BPEL} process to its partner processes. The interface of a
@acronym{BPEL} process is transformed into a set of message
channels, i.e.@: places in the Petri net.

@item In our Petri net patterns we model data, but we abstract from
the definition of the functions which edit the data. Furthermore, we
did not specify the transition guards and so we did not specify
which circumstances are necessary that a specific fault can occur.

@item Every activity is limited to one correlation set (except the
synchronous invoke which is limited to two correlation sets).

@end itemize


@anchor{Changes and Modulation}
@subsection Changes and Modulation

We tried to stick as close to the Petri net patterns of [Sta05] as
possible. However, the implemented patterns in the pattern database
sometimes differ to the given patterns due to discovery of bugs or
implementation decisions. In this subsection we sum up these changes
to help you understand the generated Petri net model.

@itemize

@item @b{Fault model}. At most one error can occur in the positive
control flow of each scope or process. Yet this confines the
possible runs of the process it is only a little change of the
semantics, since --- according to the specification --- only the
first fault is handled anyway. While further faults occurring before
the positive control flow is stopped are ignored in the original
semantics of [Sta05] (in fact, the faults are collected on place
@samp{fault_in} and then consumed by a reset arc) they are prevented
in the implemented semantics. In our model, exactly the @i{first}
occurring fault is handled, whereas in [Sta05] one fault is chosen
non-deterministically.

Furthermore, all @samp{failed} places of the activities were
removed. In the original Petri net semantics, all faults of a scope
were collected on the @samp{fault_in} of the stop-pattern and then
classified as being the first fault of the scope, a following fault,
a fault from the fault handler, a fault from the compensation
handler, or a fault from a child scope. In our implementation, new
places (@samp{fh_fault_in} and @samp{ch_fault_in}) were introduced
and each activity throws its faults to the ``correct'' place
automatically.

To ensure that at most one error can occur (i.e.@: at most one token
is produced on any fault place) the fault places are guarded by
state places: To throw a fault from an activity enclosed in a scope,
the state of that scope has to be @samp{Active}. The first thrown
fault changes the state to @samp{!Active} thus preventing more
faults to occur. The places @samp{fh_fault_in} and
@samp{ch_fault_in}, resp.@: are guarded by
@samp{!FHFaulted}/@samp{FHFaulted} and
@samp{!CHFaulted}/@samp{CHFaulted}, resp.

Moreover, the generated Petri nets have less nodes than those
generated by @acronym{BPEL2PN} [SHS05] since an unfolding of the
reset arcs in not necessary any more.

@item @b{Standard faults}. The ``throw-fault'' and ``stop'' transitions
are generated using parametrized functions. With the command-line parameter
@samp{--parameter=nostandardfaults} all @acronym{BPEL} standard faults
that can occur in the activites (i.e. all faults except user-defined faults
in a throw activity or join failures) are suppressed. The generated models
have a smaller state space and allow the analysis for controllability
which is impossible without the assumption that messages can always be
sent faultlessly.

@item @b{1-safety}. The new modeling of the fault management yields
to 1-safe Petri nets (i.e.@: any reachable state of the Petri net
model puts at most one token on each place of the net).

Beside performance (e.g.@: only 1 bit is needed to store the marking
of a place) and compatibility issues (e.g.@: 1-safety is a
prerequisite to use the Model-Checking Kit [MCK]), features not
supported by the Petri net semantics can be discovered since the
generated net will most likely violate 1-safety when an unsupported
@acronym{BPEL} feature is used. If, for example, a scope is enclosed
in a while loop (which would model instantiation which is not
supported by the Petri net semantics @ref{Limitations of the
semantics}), the state places of that scope would not be 1-safe.

@item @b{Assign activity}. All copy branches of an assign activity
are modeled in a single pattern (i.e.@: Fig.@: 6 and Fig.@: 7 are merged).
Furthermore, when an error (outside that activity) occurs, an active
assign-activity is not stopped until all copy branches have
finished. This is described in [ACD@math{^+}03] as:

@quotation
The assign activities are sufficiently short-lived that they are allowed to
complete rather than being interrupted when termination is forced.
@end quotation

This change fixes a bug in the Petri net semantics.

@item @b{While activity}. Since the original semantics does not support
instances of the BPEL process, while activities were poorly supported and
usually produced non 1-safe Petri nets or deadlocks as links embedded in
the while activity were evaluated incorrectly. In the implementation the
while activity is acyclic: the embedded activity is now executed at most
once (whether or not it is executed is decided non-deterministically).

The ``original'' behavior can be restored with the command-line parameter
@samp{--parameter=cyclicwhile}.

@item @b{Event handlers}. There is one pattern for both alarm and
message event handlers (i.e.@: Fig.@: 29 and Fig.@: 30 are merged). When
no event handler is specified, an ``implicit'' event handler is
installed which is just a stub and does not change the semantics.

@item @b{Deadlocks}. A transition named @samp{1.internal.finishloop}
can be added to livelock the process upon completion using the command-line
parameter @samp{--parameter=finishloop}. This leads to
deadlock-free Petri nets in case of processes with ``reasonable''
control flow and helps to find unwanted deadlocks occurring due
wrong modeling. If, for example, the links of a process model are
cyclic the generated Petri net will deadlock.

In future versions of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} these found deadlocks
shall be mapped back into the @acronym{BPEL} code to highlight the
``unreasonable'' activities (i.e.@: a cycle-closing link).

@item @b{Unfoldings}. Due to the abstraction (high-level to
low-level) of the patterns some places were unfolded: the place
@samp{compScope} of Fig.@: 42--44 usually holding a token with a name
of a scope is unfolded to @samp{compScope.@var{scopename}} and only
merged with the @samp{ch_in}-place of that respective scope. In all
other cases the places are ``converted'' to low-level places so the
generated model completely abstracts from data.

@item @b{Link semantics}. The generated Petri net model always
generates @samp{negLink} places for structured activities
independently of the presence of links. Anyway, the semantics is not
changed since the resulting subnets are dead in this case.

@item @b{Correlation sets}. Correlation sets are not implemented and
are simply ignored during parsing.

@node Petri Net-related Functions
@chapter Petri Net-related Functions

Currently implemented Petri net-specific functions:
@section Structural Simplification
@itemize

@item If two transitions @math{t_1} and @math{t_2} have the same
preset and postset, one of them can be removed.

@item If a transition has a singleton preset and postset, the
transition can be removed (sequence) and the preset and postset can
be merged.

@item All places with empty preset and postset (isolated places) are
removed.
@end itemize

These structural reduction rules are implemented in the command-line option
@samp{--parameter=simplify}, see @ref{Invoking BPEL2oWFN}).



@section Abstractions
@itemize

@item To obtain a place/transition Petri net from an open workflow
net the communication places are removed. This abstraction from
communicational behavior is used in all Petri net output formats
except @acronym{oWFN} (@samp{--format=owfn}).

@item The original Petri net semantics [Sta05] consists of high-level
Petri net patterns. However, the models generated from @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}
abstract from data. Therefore all transition guards, arc inscriptions
and arc types were ``converted'' to low-level constructs: all
transition guards and arc inscriptions were removed (decisions are
now made non-deterministically) and read arcs are ``unfolded'' to
loops. Due to a new fault management (see @ref{Changes and
Modulation}) the semantics does not contain any reset arcs.
@end itemize



@section Markings

The following places are initially marked to ensure a deadlock-free
model of processes with ``reasonable'' control-flow (e.g.@: with an
acyclic link structure):

@itemize
@item the initial place of the process (@samp{1.internal.initial}),

@item the variable places (@samp{variable.@var{variablename}}), and

@item the clock (@samp{1.internal.clock}).
@end itemize

@node Limitations and Bugs
@chapter Limitations and Bugs



@section Limitations

The current version of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} underlies several limitations:

@itemize
@item The pattern database consists of only one collection of patterns
(i.e.@: the semantics of [Sta05], see @cite{Petri Net Patterns}). However,
the patterns are parametrized: using the command-line arguments
@samp{--parameter=nostandardfaults} and/or @samp{--parameter=cyclicwhile}
yield to different models using the same ``base'' semantics.
@end itemize



@section Known Bugs

As this is the first public version of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} the
translation from a @acronym{BPEL} process to an open workflow net
might be unstable or incorrect in some few scenarios:

@itemize

@item @b{Problem:} The original semantics of [Sta05] was created to
support executable @acronym{BPEL} processes. Therefore the
translation of abstract @acronym{BPEL} processes (business
protocols) might throw an exception or even crash.

@b{Solution:} Each communicating activity (i.e.@: @code{invoke},
@code{receive}, @code{reply}) should be defined with (input/output)
variables.

@item @b{Problem:} The implementation of the structural reduction
rules might crash when applied to @acronym{BPEL} processes that
created Petri nets with a large number of nodes.

@b{Solution:} Avoid using the @samp{--parameter=simplify} mode in this case.

@item @b{Problem:} The parser of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} is not capable
of skipping @acronym{XML} elements originating other namespaces than
`@code{bpws}'. Processes using these elements are rejected with a
syntax error message.

@b{Solution:} Try removing or commenting these elements.

@item @b{Problem:} @acronym{LoLA} does not accept the generated files and
reports parse errors in the first line.

@b{Solution:} This problem occurs using a pre-compiled windows version
of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}. The generated files are in Windows format, yet
@acronym{LoLA} only supports files in Unix format. To overcome this
limitation of @acronym{LoLA}, use a tool like @samp{dos2unix} or
change the file format in an editor like vi.

@node Future Work
@chapter Future Work

For future releases of @acronym{BPEL2oWFN} the following features are planned:

@itemize

@item @b{Flexible model generation}. Originally, @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}
was designed to support flexible model generation, i.e.@: finding the
most abstract (thus smallest) model capable to check a given
property. With static analysis we hope to generate the smallest
Petri net possible to check properties like deadlock-freedom or
controllability.

@item @b{Add data aspects}. In the implemented patterns we abstract
from data and do not evaluate join or transition conditions. Instead all
decisions are made non-deterministically. With static analysis it is
possible to find the relevant ranges of values that allow a replacement
of non-deterministic choices with choices made evaulating data. This
technique (called @i{abstract interpretation}) might help to reduce the
modelled behavior of the process yet being more precise.

@item @b{Control flow analysis}. In [Hei03] a control flow graph for
@acronym{BPEL} was introduced. This control flow graph (currently
implemented prototypic) is the base for more sophisticated analysis,
e.g.@: finding unreachable activities, uninitialized variables or
other problems that can occur during runtime.

@item @b{More Petri net patterns}. Being feature-complete the Petri
nets generated from the Petri net semantics of [Sta05] consist of a
large number of nodes and might be to large to be analyzed by model
checkers. The elaboration of different petri net patterns
specialized for certain purposes (e.g.@: omitting the negative control
flow) does not only help to find smaller models, but is also a
prerequisite for flexible model generation.

@item @b{Detailed info-files}. The generated info-files currently just
list the nodes of the generated net. To help the retranslation of Petri
net-specific properties to the input process the generated files have
to be more detailed. The integration of a symbol table is currently
in pre-beta state and should be finished in the next version of
@acronym{BPEL2oWFN}.

@item @b{Support for @acronym{WS-BPEL}}. The specification of
@acronym{WS-BPEL, Web Service Business Process Execution Language}
version 2.0 is in its final phase. As soon as the standardization is
completed, @acronym{WS-BPEL} can be supported by @acronym{BPEL2oWFN}
by overworking the grammar and adding appropriate patterns to the
pattern database.
