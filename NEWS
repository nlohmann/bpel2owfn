Version 2.04 (not yet released)
===============================

* fixed bug #12110 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12110'): compilation errors using
  GCC 4.3.1

* adapted the cleaning scripts

* renamed Makefile target `hu-prepare' to `cvs-clean'

* added `--bug' parameter

* neither Automake nor Autoconf set any gcc parameters

* removed `extension-data.*', because nobody will be working on this

* added Makefiles for a Manpage created by help2man

* fixed a small bug that yielded parse problems when strings appeared in
  `<documentation>' elements

* renamed generated configuration header to `config.h' to achieve
  compatibility with getopt and the sources generated by GNU gengetopt

* replaced previously patched files `getopt.c', `getopt.h', and `getopt1.c'
  by standard files from GNUlib

* changed versioning scheme from `x.yz' to `x.yz' - next version ist 2.04

* completed task #6117 (`https://gna.org/task/?6117'): now using gengetopt to
  organize command line options

* completed task #6078 (`https://gna.org/task/?6078'): implement Woflan file
  format

* fixed bug #12126 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12126'): `make distcheck' does not
  finish successfully

* added Makefile targets `patch' and `patched' to create and apply patches
  against the Gna! subversion repository
  (`https://gna.org/svn/?group=service-tech')

* added a parameter `decomp' and implemented rudimentary decomposition support

* removed unnecessary files `getopt.h', `getopt.c', and `getopt1.c' from
  `src' directory

* overworked the test cases

* added code coverage checks using LTP LCOV
  (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php'); checks can be invoked in
  directory `tests' with `make prepare-cover cover'

* when static analysis checks [SA00007], [SA00077], or [SA00078] fail, the
  `error()' function is called instead of letting BPEL2oWFN run towards a
  possible segmentation fault

* completed task #6133 (`http://gna.org/task/?6133'): print number of partner
  links after parsing

* fixed a bug that occurred when BPEL2oWFN read a file from standard input

* cleaned Makefiles (removed explicit rules that were covered by implicit
  rules)

* removed maintainer scripts for Fink and RPM
