GNU BPEL2oWFN 2.0.1 fixes some bugs of the previous release.

Version 2.0.1 (11 May 2007)
---------------------------

        - fixed bugs:
             * `<if>'/`<switch>' pattern did not work with parameter
               `communicationonly'

             * `<flow>' activities in repeated constructs (`<while>',
               `<repeatUntil>', ...) could result in unbounded nets

             * parameter `xor' could crash

        - miscellaneous:
             * new parameter `nointerface' allows to create dot output
               of the generated Petri net model without drawing the
               interface

             * transitions of the Petri net model are labeled and
               colored according to their role (only for dot mode)

             * Petri net reduction rules can be chosen using the
               `reduce' option

             * improved performance of composition of nets in the
               `consistency' mode
