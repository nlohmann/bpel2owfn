PURPOSE
    A tool translating business processes described in BPEL to open workflow
    nets (oWFN). This oWFN can be used to:

    * check for controllability or generate the operating guideline using
      the tool Fiona,
    * check for deadlocks or any other Petri net property, or
    * check any temporal logic formula with a variety of model checking
      tools.

    Furthermore, GNU BPEL2oWFN can translate a BPEL4Chor choreography to a
    Petri net model. This model can be used to analyze properties of a
    complete choreography or to synthesize a fitting service for an
    incomplete choreography.

    GNU BPEL2oWFN uses static analysis to make the generated Petri net model
    as compact as possible to analyze a chosen property. This is called
    flexible model generation. Furthermore, several design flaws can be
    detected using control and data flow analysis.
