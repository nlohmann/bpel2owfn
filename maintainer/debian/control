Description: a tool to translate BPEL processes into Petri nets
 BPEL2oWFN is a tool translating business processes described in BPEL to
 open workflow nets (oWFN). This oWFN can be used to (1) check for
 controllability or generate the operating guideline using the tool Fiona
 or Wendy, (2) check for deadlocks or any other Petri net property using
 the tool LoLA, or (3) check any temporal logic formula with a variety of
 model checking tools.
 Furthermore, BPEL2oWFN can translate a BPEL4Chor choreography to a
 Petri net model. This model can be used to analyze properties of a
 complete choreography or to synthesize a fitting service for an
 incomplete choreography.
 BPEL2oWFN uses static analysis to make the generated Petri net model
 as compact as possible to analyze a chosen property. This is called
 flexible model generation. Furthermore, several design flaws can be
 detected using control and data flow analysis.
