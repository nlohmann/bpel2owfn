===============================================================================
                A GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE FOR GNU BPEL2oWFN
===============================================================================



SHORT INFORMATION
-----------------

To create the GUI as a Mac OS X application called `BPEL2oWFN.app':

    qmake
    make
    cp ../src/bpel2owfn BPEL2oWFN.app/Contents/Resources


To create a Mac OS X installation package called `BPEL2oWFN.pkg':

    ./static_release.sh



DETAILED INFORMATION
--------------------

To bootstrap, type `qmake'. Then, you can use `make' to generate C++ code from
the designed UI and to translate it. Note that the generated application
(BPEL2oWFN.app for Mac OS X) DOES NOT WORK LIKE THIS. To make it work, execute
the following line

          `cp ../src/bpel2owfn BPEL2oWFN.app/Contents/Resources'

to copy the built executable of BPEL2oWFN into the generated application. This
executable is called by the GUI. To make life easier, execute the script
`static_release.sh' after tidying up with `make distclean'. This will create
an installation package `BPEL2oWFN.pkg' which contains a correct application.



FILES
-----

dialog.ui         The graphical user interface itself, described as XML file
                  created by the Qt Designer. The dialogs does not contain any
                  connections -- they are defined elsewhere. Note that the
                  dialog has some "hidden" widgets in the beginning of the file
                  (i.e., widgets that were not defined in the Qt Designer).

bpel2owfn-gui.cc  The main C++ file for the graphical user interface. Includes
                  the generated code of Qt, creates an GUI organizer object,
                  and defines all the connections of the GUI elements.

gui_organizer.*   An organizer object that implements the connections of the
                  GUI. This object defines the whole behavior of the GUI without
                  referencing the GUI objects itself. Thus, the behavior is
                  totally independent of the layout and the operating system.

BPEL2oWFN.pro     A project file for qmake. It is read by qmake to create the
                  Makefile for the GUI. It is currently only tested with
                  Mac OS X.
                  
BPEL2oWFN.qrc     This file lists all resources that have to be copied into the
                  created application such as icons or graphics. Qt creates a
                  C++ file which then describes these files.
                  
translation-de.ts A translation of the GUI elements to German. Incomplete and
                  not yet used.

BPEL2oWFN.pmproj  A project for the Apple PackageMaker. It creates a .pkg file
                  from the generated application (BPEL2oWFN.app) and uses some
                  files in the `resource' directory. Please use the shell script
                  `static_release.h' to automate the package building. THE
                  APPLICATION WILL NOT WORK WHEN ONLY BUILT WITH `make'!

static_release.sh A shell script to automatically build an Apple installation
                  package. The script creates a stand-alone application which
                  is statically linked against Qt. The static version is
                  assumed to be in the directory `~/Downloads/qt-static/bin'.
                  The PakckageMaker has to be run as super user, so the script
                  will prompt for the passwort after creating the application.
                  Furthermore, the built executable of BPEL2oWFN is assumed to
                  be in the directory `../src'. This executable is copied into
                  the application (BPEL2oWFN.app). Note that the script will
                  try to tidy the directory with `make distclean' which will
                  fail if the directory was tidied before. So don't worry about
                  a failure at the beginning.

resource/bpel.png
resource/bpel4chor.png  Graphics for the GUI. They are linked into the
                        application with the help of the file `BPEL2oWFN.qrc'.

resource/bpel2owfn.icns The file icon of the generated application (the Mac
                        version). The icon is mentioned in file `BPEL2oWFN.pro'.

resource/background.jpg This background is used by the Apple PackageMaker for
                        the installation package.
                        
resource/gpl.rtf        The GNU GPL v2 which is displayed in the installation
                        package.
                        
resource/about.rtfd     The welcome message for the installation package.
