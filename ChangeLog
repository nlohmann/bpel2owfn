Change Log
**********

Most recent version at the end of this section.

Version 1.0 (16 January 2006)
   - input:
        * BPEL process compliant to the specificiation BPEL4WS version
          1.1, May 2003.

   - output:
        * LoLA Petri net

        * open workflow net

        * Dot representation

   - implemented patterns:
        * Christian Stahl. A Petri Net Semantics for BPEL.
          Informatik-Berichte 188, Humboldt-Universita"t zu Berlin,
          July 2005.

Version 1.1 (24 February 2006)
   - new output formats:
        * APNN (Abstract Petri Net Notation) Petri net

        * PNML (Petri Net Markup Language) Petri net

        * low-level PEP (Programming Environment based on Petri Nets)
          Petri net

   - overworked patterns:
        * the Stahl-semantics (see version 1.0) has been enhanced and
          can be parametrized:
             * original semantics

             * models without BPEL's standard faults

             * acyclic models
          For more information please refer to the User's Manual.

   - static analysis:
        * To reduce the size of the Petri net model static analysis is
          used to only generate nodes for the DPE (dead path
          elimination) when necessary.

   - miscellaneous:
        * The compiler generator tools Flex, Bison and Kimwitu++ are
          not any more necessary to compile BPEL2oWFN: the generated
          sources are now part of the distrubution.

        * The oWFN format was overworked and allows final markings.

        * GNU getopt allows more flexible command-line parameter
          processing allowing to create several output file formats in
          a single run.

        * Debug output can be written into a log file.

        * The classes organizing the Petri nets are overworked for
          performance and extensibility.

   - fixed bugs:
        * The generation of all possible types of the `<invoke>'
          activity (synchronous, asynchronous, with and without
          implicit scope) is overworked and does produce errorenous
          nets.
