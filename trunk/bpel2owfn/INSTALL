BEGIN OF INSTALL file for BPEL2oWFN Version 1.0

Setup and Installation
**********************

Compilation
===========

The compilation BPEL2oWFN is controlled by several Makefiles. Make sure
that all required programs (see *Note Required Programs::) are
reachable in your path. To compile BPEL2oWFN, just run `make'. After
successful compilation an executable file `bpel2owfn' (or
`bpel2owfn.exe' on systems running Microsoft Windows) is created in the
directory `bpel2owfn-1.0/src' of the distribution. This file has no
dependencies to other files of the distribution and can be copied to any
directory.

Any warning during an in other respects successful compilation can be
ignored--these warnings mostly occur in generated files from Flex,
Bison or Kimwitu++ and are outside of our scope.

BPEL2oWFN was tested on several operating systems such as Microsoft
Windows (running cygwin), Linux and Sun OS. Anyway, if the compilation
fails please make sure you use the most recent versions of the GNU
Compiler Collection, Flex, Bison and Kimwitu++. If this does not help
please send us an electronic mail to <nlohmann@informatik.hu-berlin.de>.
Include the version number of your distribution (version 1.0 of 26
January 2006). Also include in your message the output that the make
process produced. We will try to answer your mail within a week.

If you are not interested in compiling BPEL2oWFN yourself you can
alternatively download executable binaries for several operating
systems on the website of BPEL2oWFN
(`http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/tools4bpel/bpel2owfn').

Makefile Targets
================

`all'
     Compile BPEL2oWFN and create an executable binary `bpel2owfn' (or
     `bpel2owfn.exe' on systems running Microsoft Windows) in the
     directory `bpel2owfn-1.0/src'.

`dvi'
`html'
`pdf'
`ps'
`info'
     Generate documentation files in the given format which can be DVI,
     HTML, PDF, PostScript or GNU Info. The documentation is generated
     in the directory `bpel2owfn-1.0/doc' and is named
     `bpel2owfn.FORMAT' (User's Manual) and `install.FORMAT'
     (Installation Manual), resp.

`clean'
     Clean all temporary files created during the compilation.
     Executables as well as generated documentation are preserved.

`distclean'
     Clean everything that does not belong to the distribution, i.e.
     any file created during compilation. Executables as well as
     created documentation files are also removed.

`check'
     Perform a number of self-tests: the directory `test' contains
     several BPEL processes which are read and compiled.

`dist'
     Create a zipped distribution tar file containing all files of the
     distribution (calls `distclean' before).

For the compilation of the sources in the directory `bpel2owfn-1.0/src'
it is possible to set an optimization level of `g++' by setting a
variable `OPTIMIZE'. For example, `make OPTIMIZE=-O3' invokes a
compilation with all possible optimization which yields to a smaller
and faster executable and longer compilation time.

Needed Programs
***************

Required Programs
=================

To compile BPEL2oWFN you need the following programs. These programs
are (as BPEL2oWFN itself) free software distributed under the GNU
General Public License.

Flex, A fast scanner generator
     Flex is needed to generate the lexer of BPEL2oWFN. Flex was written
     by Vern Paxon. Copyright (C) 1990 The Regents of the University of
     California. All rights reserved. Flex is available under
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/flex.html'.

Bison, The YACC-compatible Parser Generator
     Bison is needed to generate the parser of BPEL2oWFN. Bison was
     written by Robert Corbett und Richard Stallman. Copyright (C) 1992,
     1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005 Free Software Foundation, Inc. Bison
     is available under `http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html'.

Kimwitu++, The Term Processor
     Kimwitu++ is needed to generate all files managing the AST
     (abstract syntax tree). Kimwitu++ was written by Toby Neumann and
     Michael Piefel.  Copyright (C) 1988-1997  Axel Belinfante,
     University of Twente.  Copyright (C) 1997-2000  Michael Piefel,
     Humboldt-University Berlin.  Kimwitu++ is available under
     `http://site.informatik.hu-berlin.de/kimwitu++'.

Optional Programs
=================

BPEL2oWFN is a compiler and thus creating output files which can be
read by several other programs. These programs are not needed to compile
BPEL2oWFN yet without these programs BPEL2oWFN makes not much sense.

LoLA, a Low Level Petri net Analyzer
     LoLA is an explicit model checker implementing a broad variety of
     reduction techniques such as partial order reduction, symmetries
     or the sweep line method. LoLA was written by Karsten Schmidt and
     is available under
     `http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~kschmidt/lola.html'.

Graphviz, the Graph Visualization Software
     Graphviz is a graph visualization software with several graph
     layout programs including dot. Graphviz is maintained by AT&T Labs
     and is available under `http://www.graphviz.org'.
