Change Log
**********

Most recent version at the end of this section.

Version 1.0 (16 January 2006)
-----------------------------

   - input:
        * BPEL process compliant to the specificiation BPEL4WS version
          1.1, May 2003.

   - output:
        * LoLA Petri net

        * open workflow net

        * Dot representation

   - implemented patterns:
        * Christian Stahl. A Petri Net Semantics for BPEL.
          Informatik-Berichte 188, Humboldt-Universita"t zu Berlin,
          July 2005.

Version 1.1 (24 February 2006)
------------------------------

   - new output formats:
        * APNN (Abstract Petri Net Notation) Petri net

        * PNML (Petri Net Markup Language) Petri net

        * low-level PEP (Programming Environment based on Petri Nets)
          Petri net

   - overworked patterns:
        * the Stahl-semantics (see version 1.0) has been enhanced and
          can be parametrized:
             * original semantics

             * models without BPEL's standard faults

             * acyclic models
          For more information please refer to the User's Manual.

   - static analysis:
        * To reduce the size of the Petri net model static analysis is
          used to only generate nodes for the DPE (dead path
          elimination) when necessary.

   - miscellaneous:
        * The compiler generator tools Flex, Bison and Kimwitu++ are
          not any more necessary to compile BPEL2oWFN: the generated
          sources are now part of the distrubution.

        * The oWFN format was overworked and allows final markings.

        * GNU getopt allows more flexible command-line parameter
          processing allowing to create several output file formats in
          a single run.

        * Debug output can be written into a log file.

        * The classes organizing the Petri nets are overworked for
          performance and extensibility.

   - fixed bugs:
        * The generation of all possible types of the `<invoke>'
          activity (synchronous, asynchronous, with and without
          implicit scope) is overworked.

Version 1.2 (6 April 2006)
--------------------------

   - overworked patterns:
        * more parameterized versions of the Stahl-semantics (see
          version 1.1):
             * acyclic models (also acyclic event handlers)

             * models without variables

             * models without standard faults occuring while handling a
               fault
          For more information please refer to the User's Manual.

   - static analysis:
        * A control flow graph can be built and used to detect the use
          of uninitialized variables.

   - miscellaneous:
        * The command-line parameter `-p finishloop' is renamed to `-p
          finalloop'.

        * Structural reduction rules remove all structural dead nodes
          of the generated Petri net model.

   - fixed bugs:
        * Pattern of asynchronous `<invoke>' activity does no longer
          receive messages.

        * Structural reduction rules no longer change the semantics of
          the `<switch>' activity.

        * Structural reduction rules no longer remove the loop
          transition for deadlock search.

Version 2.0.0 (20 April 2007)
-----------------------------

   - input:
        * executable BPEL4WS 1.1 processes

        * executable WS-BPEL 2.0 processes

        * abstract BPEL4WS 1.1 processes (experimental)

        * abstract WS-BPEL 2.0 processes (experimental)

   - output:
        * Petri net file formats: APNN, INA (untimed, low-level), LoLA
          (low-level), Fiona oWFN, PEP notation (low-level), PNML (with
          extension to model interfaces), SPIN (Promela)

        * other file formats: Graphviz dot, XML

   - implemented patterns:
        * overworked feature-complete Petri net semantics for BPEL4WS
          1.1 and WS-BPEL 2.0

        * overworked simplified Petri net semantics to model the
          communicational behavior only

        * several versions of each pattern controlled by command-line
          parameters

   - static analysis
        * 44 of 94 static analysis goals of the WS-BPEL specification
          are checked

        * read access to uninitialized variables can be detected using
          the CFG (control flow graph)

        * conflicting receiving activities can be detected using the CFG

   - miscellaneous:
        * completely overworked architecture

        * all Petri net-related functions are packaged to a Petri net
          API (application programming interface) to be published
          independently of BPEL2oWFN soon

        * statistics of the input process are displayed after implicit
          transformation rules are applied

        * messages are classified (error, warning, etc.) and numbered
          to allow for a detailed description in the manual

Version 2.0.1 (11 May 2007)
---------------------------

        - fixed bugs:
             * `<if>'/`<switch>' pattern did not work with parameter
               `communicationonly'

             * `<flow>' activities in repeated constructs (`<while>',
               `<repeatUntil>', ...) could result in unbounded nets

             * parameter `xor' could crash

        - miscellaneous:
             * new parameter `nointerface' allows to create dot output
               of the generated Petri net model without drawing the
               interface

             * transitions of the Petri net model are labeled and
               colored according to their role (only for dot mode)

             * Petri net reduction rules can be chosen using the
               `reduce' option

             * improved performance of composition of nets in the
               `consistency' mode

Version 2.0.2 (15 June 2007)
----------------------------

        - new features:
             * BPEL4Chor choreographies can be translated (further
               information to come)

             * WSDL files can be parsed to support the translation of a
               BPEL process

             * abstract BPEL processes (both BPEL4WS 1.1 and WS-BPEL
               2.0) are now parsed

        - miscellaneous:
             * when parsing multiple BPEL processes, wildcard like
               `*.bpel' can be used
